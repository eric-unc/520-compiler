Okay so...

My project follows a particular structure. I have taken out the miniJava package for autograding purposes, but the entirety
of my project is really in the "520-compiler" directory. It's divided like this:
* `README.md` contains a good general description, with the scope of the project (listing extensions too), and also
changes in the AST package (which there were a lot of).
* `src/main/java` contains the source code for the compiler (basically just the `miniJava` package).
* `src/test/java` contains all of the JUnit 5 tests, meanwhile...
* `src/test/resources` contains all of the sample source files used by those tests.

To actually run the tests, you can use the Gradle "test" task. Or if using Gradle is too much of a PITA (it might be),
you can just browse `build/reports/tests/test/packages/miniJava.html` to see that they do indeed pass.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me.
