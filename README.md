# 520-compiler
A "miniJava" compiler, as created for COMP 520.

## Features supported
Currently none!

## Usage
The compiler should be used through the command line, through arguments:
* The first argument is the file to be compiled.
* A second optional argument that can be supplied is `--debug`, which only exists for internal debugging purposes.

## License
As you can see in the [license file](LICENSE), this project is under the "Unlicense" which effectively releases it into the public domain. Basically, do what you want with my code. However, I don't recommend using the code for reference for COMP 520; Professor Prins explicitly doesn't allow this, and the particular subset to implement will change year-to-year. Plus it is rather rewarding to create something by yourself from scratch.
